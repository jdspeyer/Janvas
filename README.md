<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Janvas

Janvas is a Javascript library that attempts to make working with 2D Contexts in WebGL easier. It is a small, but streamlined library that aims to allow the creation of everything from interfaces to games. :smile:

It is still early in the devlopment life cycle, but thank you for checking the project out.
