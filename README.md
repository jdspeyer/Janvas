<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Janvas

Janvas is a Javascript library that attempts to make working with 2D Contexts in WebGL easier. It is a small, but streamlined library that aims to allow the creation of everything from interfaces to games. :smile:

It is still early in the devlopment life cycle, but thank you for checking the project out.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To be added once Janvas is ready to be tested. The following steps in the installation process are simply placeholder instructions and will be expanded upon when tested.

### Installation

1. Download the Janvas.zip file directly from the repository. 
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jdspeyer/Janvas.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- Devlog -->
## Devlog

Each update the changed features will be reflected here. This will be moved to the documentation website when the library is completed, but in the mean time changes will be visible here.

### indev0.1 (June 23, 2022)
- [x] Uploaded first commit to GitHub.
- [x] Assets can be loaded into the library. 
    - [x] Images (Sprite sheets & static images)
    - [x] Sound (SFX & Music)
- [x] Any number of layers can be generated on the fly.
- [x] Modules load in automatically when the Janvas.js is added to the webpage (script tag)
- [ ] Animations were started. Not completed. Issues with deciding what prototypes should be the ones writing to the canvas(s).

### indev0.2 (June 27, 2022)
It has been a few days, but this update expands greatly on the sprite sheet capabilities of Janvas.
- [x] Modular character can hold various items in test script (Script.js located in Games folder)
- [x] Character states are animated. 
    - [x] Idle animation (character.idle())
    - [x] Attack animation (character.attack())
    - [x] Damage animation (character.damage())
    - [x] Evade animation (character.evade())
    - [x] Block animation (character.block()) NOTE: Test scene does not include weapon with this animation. Was not included in the asset pack being used.
    - [x] Walk animation (character.moveto(x))
- [x] Pixel density of the WebGL canvas can now adjusted in the HTML Dom using the "height" and "width" attributes.
- [x] Commented older functions so that future development would be easier.
- [x] Weapons can change the attack animations of the character.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jdspeyer/Janvas/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
